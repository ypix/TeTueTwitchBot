## References

This repository has been folked from 
* https://github.com/Technik-Tueftler/TeTueTwitchBot

This version uses rasa and tensorflow to detect abusing messages.
A simple example can be found in the file [*test_rasa.py*](./test\test_rasa.py)  

Before running example make sure the models directory in the rasa subfolder contains a trained model file. 
To create
* open a terminal
* move to folder ``rasa`` with *cd* 
* run  ``rasa train`` in the terminal

To start a test, open a terminal and execute
* ``test\test_rasa.py``

Expected oucome:

``{'text': 'Du bl√∂des A***', 'intent': {'id': ..., 'name': 'abuse', 'confidence': 0.7838521599769592}, 'entities': ...``

The NLU data for training can be found in [nlu.yml](rasa/data/nlu.yml)

The part for abuse data starts with
```
- intent: abuse
  examples: |
    - you fucker
    - you asshole
    - sucker
```
